<h1><p><strong>Description</strong></p></h1>
A very popular West African street food that’s quick and easy to make with different variations. Dangerously delicious and addicting!
<p><h1>Ingredients</h1></p>
<ul>
<li>flour</li>
<li>yeast</li>
<li>warm water</li>
<li>salt</li>
<li>sugar</li>
<li>cooking oil</li>
</ul>
<p><h1><strong>STEPS</strong></h1></p>
<ol>
<li>Rest and Rise: Let the mixture rise for approximately 1-2 hours (See photos 3-5)</li>
<li>
    Pre-heat the oil: In a large sauce pan, pour vegetable oil into a pot until it’s about 3 inches (or 5 centimeters ) high (too little will result into a flatter balls), and place in low heat
</li>
<li>
    Test to make sure the oil is hot enough by putting a drop of batter into the oil. If the oil is not hot enough, the batter will stay at the bottom instead of rising to the top.
</li>
<li>
    Hand Method: Using your hands, grab a little bit of mixture at a time and drop into the oil. (See photo 6)
Spoon Method: When the oil is hot enough, use a spoon to dish up the batter and another spoon or spatula to drop it in the oil. Sort of in the shape of a ball.
</li>
<li>
    Check the doneness: Fry for a few minutes until the bottom side is golden brown 

</li>
<li>
    Use a large spoon or a slotted spoon to take it out of the oil. I usually place them on napkins right away to soak up some of the excess oil.
</li>
<li>
    If desired, you can roll up the finished products in table sugar or powdered sugar to make it sweeter.
    There you have it. Delicious puff puff!
